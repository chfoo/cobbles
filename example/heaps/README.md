# Heaps example

This is an example on how to use Cobbles for Heaps.io.

You can build the example yourself using one of the hxml files in the `hxml/` directory. The current directory should be at the root of the Cobbles source code For example,

    haxe hxml/example_heaps.js.hxml

will generate the application into `out/js/`.

The Noto fonts used in the demo are not included since they are relatively large. Download them and place them at

* resource/fonts/noto/NotoSans-Regular.ttf
* resource/fonts/noto/NotoSansArabic-Regular.ttf
* resource/fonts/noto/NotoSansCJKsc-Regular.otf
